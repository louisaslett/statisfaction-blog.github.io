Version 0.4 of [particles](https://github.com/nchopin/particles) have just been released. 
Here are the main changes:

# Single-run variance estimation for waste-free SMC

Waste-free SMC [(Dau & Chopin,
2020)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/84/1/114/7056097) was already
implemented in particles (since version 0.3), and even proposed by default. This
is a variant of SMC samplers where you resample only  $M \ll
N$ particles, apply to each resampled particle $P-1$ MCMC steps, and then gather these
$M\times P$ states to form the next particle sample; see the paper if you want
to know why this is a good idea (short version: this tends to perform better
than standard SMC samplers, and to be more robust to the choice of the number of
MCMC steps). 

What was not yet implemented (but is, in this version) is the **single-run**
variance estimates proposed in the same paper. Here is a simple illustration:

![](ibis_pima_var_post.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

![](ibis_pima_var_logLt.png){fig-align="center" width=60%}

Both plots were obtained from $10^3$ runs of waste-free IBIS (i.e. target at
time $t$ is the posterior based on the first $t+1$ observations,
$p(\theta|y_{0:t})$) applied to Bayesian logistic regression and the Pima
Indians dataset. The red line is the empirical variance of the output, and,
since the number of runs is large, it should be close to the true variance. The
lower (resp. upper) limit of the grey area is the $5\%$ (resp. $95\%$) quantile
of the single-run variance estimates obtained from these $10^3$ runs. The considered
output is either the posterior mean of the intercept (top) or the log marginal
likelihood (bottom). 

We can see from these plots that these single-run estimates are quite reliable,
and make it possible, in case one uses IBIS, to obtain error bars even from a
single run. See the documention of module `smc_samplers` (or the scripts in
`papers/wastefreeSMC`) for more details on how you may get such estimates.

# New FFBS variants

I have already mentioned in a previous
[post](https://statisfaction.wordpress.com/2022/11/09/new-smoothing-algorithms-in-particles/),
on the old blog, that particles now implement new FFBS algorithms (i.e. particle
smoothing algorithms that rely on a backward step) that were proposed in 
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00976). On top of
that, particles now also includes a hybrid version of the Paris algorithm.

# Nested sampling

I was invited to [this](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/maxent2023) nested sampling
workshop in Munich, so this gave me some incentive to:

* clean up and document the "vanilla" nested sampling implementation which was in module `nested`. 

* add to the same module the NS-SMC samplers of [Salomone et al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03924)
  to play with them and do some numerical experiments to illustrate my talk. 

I will blog shortly about the interesting results I found (which essentiaZZlly are
in line with Salmone et al). 

# Other minor changes

Several distributions and a dataset (Liver) were added, see the [change log](https://github.com/nchopin/particles/releases/tag/v0.4).

# Logo

I've added a [logo](https://github.com/nchopin/particles/blob/master/logo.png). It's... not great, if anyone has suggestions on how to
design a better log, I am all ears. 

# What's next? 

I guess what's still missing from the package are stuff like:

* the ensemble Kalman filter, which would be reasonably easy to add, and would
  be useful in various problems; 

* advanced methods to design better proposals, such as controlled SMC [(Heng et
al, 2020)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-48/issue-5/Controlled-sequential-Monte-Carlo/10.1214/19-AOS1914.short) or the iterated auxiliary particle filter [(Guarniero et al, 2017)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2016.1222291). 

If you have other ideas, let me know.
