Hey! We have just moved this blog from Wordpress to github. The old version
is still available [here](https://statisfaction.wordpress.com/). The new
version is based on [quarto](https://quarto.org/), which will make it much
easier to write mathematics, e.g. $\pi(\theta|x) \propto \pi(\theta)
L(x|\theta)$, and code, e.g. 

```python
import numpy as np

def fact(n):
    return np.prod(range(1, n + 1))
```
